## Project Scope

The scope of the project is to understand how the AXI4-Lite communication protocol works, and
design by ourselves an "AXI interconnect" component (that we called CCCAXI) to replace the real
one inside the Arm Cortex-M3 DesignStart FPGA-Xilinx edition, to observe its behaviour and the
differences respect to the real one..
